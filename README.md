# ðŸ›’ Customer Segmentation of a Retail Store using K-Means Clustering

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project segments customers of a retail store based on their **purchase behavior** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.  
By analyzing **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, the algorithm groups customers into distinct clusters, helping businesses identify high-value customers, budget-conscious shoppers, and occasional buyers.  



## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Group customers into meaningful segments.  
- Analyze patterns in customer demographics and purchasing behavior.  
- Visualize clusters for better understanding of customer segments.  
- Provide actionable insights for marketing strategies and business decisions.  



## ðŸ§© Features
âœ… Load and preprocess the dataset  
âœ… Apply K-Means clustering for customer segmentation  
âœ… Determine optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**  
âœ… Visualize clusters in 2D  
âœ… Assign cluster labels to customers for further analysis
